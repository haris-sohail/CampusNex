## Introduction

### Product

CampusNex is a **Desktop Application** built by our team ‘AceCoders' to serve as a **centralized platform** for managing societies operations and enhancing collaboration.


### Modules

Based on time, cost and other resources, we set the scope of our project and shortlisted the following modules for development

- User Authentication
- Societies Management and Approval
- Dynamic Societies Search
- Event Management and Approval
- Member Registration
- Announcements Management

### Approach

This project was built by following the popular SCRUM methodology of Agile development under the guidance of our course instructor, Sir Bilal Khalid Dar. The requirements, design and implementation were wisely divided to achieve the best product we can in the span of 3 Iterations. CampusNex’s modular approach is also guided by the following roles:

- **Mentor:** A user that can mentor societies and is able to view all
	registered societies and events. They can accept or reject society
	mentorship and event registration.
- **Society Head:** A user that registers and leads a society. They can
	view and organize society events and accept new members in
	their societies as well as post new society announcements.
- **Member:** A user that is a member of society and can view their
	society related events as well as organize them. They can
	collaborate with society by viewing society announcements.
- **Student:** A user that can view society details and either join a
	society of interest or request to create a new society if mentors
	are available.

### Technical Description

CampusNex follows an **Object-Oriented structure** and its functionality is in accordance with **MVC** architecture. It is built using Visual Studio’s **C# Windows Form** with **SQL** for backend. For aesthetic purposes we used **Bunifu Framework** which helped us create an exquisite **GUI.** CampusNex is a collaborative project built using **Github** as a base platform for ease and will be made public with proper documentation soon.
